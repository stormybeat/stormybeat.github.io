<h3>Willkommen | Welcome</h1>

<p> Welcome to my page, <b>ignore the mess,</b> it's very under construction. <br> For now, I'll just tell you a bit about myself.</p>

<p> This page was made as an excuse to learn HTML and CSS, as well as because discord doesn't allow a long enough "about me" for me, because I can talk about myself for forever.</p>
